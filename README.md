# Warhammer40brew

## Motivation 
Making a wargame that is fast paced, balanced enjoyable, allowing any player to play with any model from their collection. Warhammer 40k is a wargame that exist first and foremost to sell models and associated rulebooks, not to be a good game. 
A lot of odd design choices in mainline 40k (any edition) is a consequence of trying to differentiate units because they are separate product, not because it would make lore sense.  
 
   
## Identified problems

### Rule themselves           
The IGO UGO structure of the turn lead to very passive gameplay for one of the player       
The IGO UGO structure of the turns lead to a massive emphasis on player order : The one that get to shoot first at their opponent units have a massive advantage, or the one that manage to hide it's unit (eg  : reserve) get a massive advantage.           
Getting shot at is not very fun and uninteractive. You don't make choices outside of the odd stratagem or rerolling a failed save.          
Stratagems are a decent idea (meta special abilities) implemented badly and unevenly accross armies.            
Too many profiles for what is essentially the same thingy (eg : A boltgun vs a super special boltgun)                

### Datasheet
Some things that should be USR are not                    
Too many units have no defined roles or suck at it                    
Poor internal balance and poor external balance of too many armies                      
 
### Army building
Points are just a ressource in army building. You cannot balance everything with just points, as some armies have a very deep datasheet list or "aspect warriors" style units doing a job well with dedicated special weapons while others don't.     
    
### Missions          
While current rules are much better than past "kill everyone" or "score point for killing" missions, they feel very gamey and lack narrative that would justify sacrificing a chapter master and it's squad of terminators for 1 turn on an objective.              
Trading is encouraged, surviving is not.        

## Design philosophy 

-Players action should be fast paced and done as interactively as possible : EG being LOTR, Kill Team         
-Armies should have playstyles that separate them from each others             
-Each unit should have a role that their rules allow them to do well, so that balance can come from points/other ressource spending and not making a garbage unit so cheap that their new role become being a filler.      
-Similar guns should have the same profile accross all armies      
-All the rules to play a unit should be present on the datasheet         
-Army wide rules should fit on a single page          
-A ressource other than points need to exist to balance army composition
-Missions should be actual tactical puzzle to accomplish an objective, not just always a midfield brawl            
-Most guns should be able to shoot from one side of the table to the other    
-Indirect fire guns should award victory points, not hits 20m away.
